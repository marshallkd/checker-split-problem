# checker-split-problem
This is a small interactive example of one of my favorite math problems. The problem begins with a checker on each of the red squares in the bottom left. A move consists of removing a checker and then placing one above and one to the right of the removed position *if* these squares are empty. If these squares already have checkers, the move is not allowed. 

It can be easily (sort of) shown that you can never remove all the checkers from the red region, but many people do not believe it at first and want to tinker with the problem.
